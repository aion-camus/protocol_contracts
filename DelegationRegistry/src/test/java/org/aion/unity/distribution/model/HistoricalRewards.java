 * Historical Reward Value

 *
 * Reference count indicates the number of objects which might need to reference this historical entry at any point.
 * It is equal to { the number of outstanding delegations which ended the associated period (and might need to
 * read that record) } + { one per pool for the zeroth period, set on initialization }.
