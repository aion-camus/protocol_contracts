/**
 * Notes on Precision Selection
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * WLOG, all amounts are denominated in some units of "coin".
 *
 * When we refer to "precision", we mean the number of decimal places required to represent the smallest possible real
 * number that can arise when we divide the smallest unit of staked coin, with the largest size of the pool.
 *
 * Such quantity required in the computation of the F1 rewards distribution scheme.
 *
 * Consider the following degenerate case: all coins in the system are delegated to one pool, and a delegator has
 * staked 1 coin to this pool. In this case, the maximum decimal "precision" we need is the number of decimal places
 * required to represent (max # of coins in the system)^-1
 *
 * Now, if there is an upper limit to the number of coins that can be delegated to a pool, then the "precision" we
 * need would be the number of decimal places required to represent (max # of coins per pool)^-1. In the
 * absence of such a maximum, in the design of this system, we fall-back to the "precision" that depends on the max #
 * of coins in the system.
 *
 * Furthermore, we run into another problem here; the max # of coins in the system has not been defined for Aion. In
 * order to resolve this, we consider the maximum number which can be represented by a 64-bit signed (Java) long,
 * the number of decimal places required is ceil(log_10(2^63 - 1)) = ceil(18.96) = 19 ~ 20.
 *
 * Assuming the AVM data-word limit of 128-bit unsigned integer, the number of decimal places required
 * is ceil(log_10(2^128 - 1)) = ceil(38.53) = 39 ~ 40.
 *
 * We pick 20 decimal places as the "precision" in this proof of concept.
 *
 * Under such a precision regime:
 * > All additions and subtractions can be computed without precision loss
 * > Multiplications would need to be performed with double the precision (40 decimal places), which is then
 *    truncated down to 20 decimal places.
 *
 * Miscellaneous Notes for the Implementor
 * ---------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. We've used long to represent all "coin" units in this system. A decision needs to be made about the units used
 *    in the smart contract; if we're using base units (nAmp) or Aion, or some other quanta of coin.
